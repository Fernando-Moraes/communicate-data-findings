# Communicate Data Finfinds

## Why this project?
Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed. Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

## Project Details
1- Dataset: Ford GoBike
2- Explore the data: Feel free to explore the jupyter notebook where the dataset is visually, and programatically explored.
3- Document the story: organized findings convey a story to present to an audience.
4- Communicate the findings - a slide deck with my findings is prepared for a curious audience.
