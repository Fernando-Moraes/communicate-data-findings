    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, the Ford GoBike System Dateset that contains trip data from lyft's bike service for public use was analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ford GoBike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements and more. It's a fun, convenient and affordable way to get around.\n",
